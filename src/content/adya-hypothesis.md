# The Adya Analysis: A Threat Hunter’s Overly Simple Accidental Discovery

If you’ve ever stared at a mountain of DNS logs and thought, Surely, there must be a better way,’ congratulations—you’re already halfway to discovering the Adya analysis.

Threat hunting is a lot about data science which involves understanding data sets (Web server logs, DNS logs, Process image paths, File hashes etc.), data cleaning & preprocessing, creating correlations, joining, data analysis etc. 

The [PEAK Threat hunting framework](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/peak-threat-hunting-framework.html) (from Splunk) describes three types of hunt : hypothesis-driven, baseline, and model-assisted but here the main focus is to minimize the gathered large data-sets and not the hunt itself.

With Adya, a baseline of the current day’s logs/data is created & analyzed against the previous two days. The idea here is to simply reduce noise by eliminating repeated/historical entries, producing a clean dataset for today’s hunt. 


## Where It All Started

Picture this: a threat hunter drowning in global-enterprise-scale DNS logs, trying to make sense of an avalanche of repeated domain lookups. Then comes the lightbulb moment:
**What if we only looked at what happened just _today_?**

## Meet Adya

“Adya” comes from the Sanskrit word **“अद्य”**, meaning *Today* or *Now.* , so the idea is to focus on the present-day logs only & treat anything irrelevant that did not occur today. 

## The Magic Rule
The concept is beautifully simple:
1. Assume the suspicious activity or incident happened today.  
2. Ignore everything that also happened yesterday or the day before that.

## Why?
Because logs have trust issues.  
They repeat themselves. A lot.

## Why It Works
Cutting out repetitive historical data leads to:
- Smaller datasets  
- Faster hunting cycles  
- Cleaner signals  
- Fewer headaches  

And it’s not just for DNS! Startup persistence artifacts, Batch files, weird processes, if it happened today and not recently—boom, Adya it.

## Final Thoughts

The Adya analysis is close to Jason Bourne of threat hunting: it wakes up with no memory of the past, hunts only what’s new, unexpected, and potentially dangerous today.
To get rid of more irrelevant data, increase the time-window to 3, 4 or 5 days instead of just past 2 days.
There are many ways to achieve Adya: Python scripting, AI agents, directly querying the Data lake, SIEM, EDR.
